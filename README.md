Hi, I'm Lordi, I tried to call myself a demon but but apparently I'm "just an imp". I like to code, but I do art sometimes too.
I started programming when I was 8 in Scratch, but quickly moved on to Python, so that's what I'm most experienced with, but I also know a little C#.

I tend to make lots of little utilities and tools to help me out with day to day tasks or for analysing data, so they may not be of much use to you.
